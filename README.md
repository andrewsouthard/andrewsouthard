💼 At Strava, I build progress features for millions of athletes in Rails and Scala. Recently our team shipped progress analysis to help athletes get a fuller picture of their performance over time.

🗺️ In my free time, I’m exploring the intersection of UI/UX, LLMs and local first software. Check out my pinned repositories and [my blog](https://andrewsouthard.com/blog) to see what I'm up to!

💡 I'm inspired by [Ink and Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/), [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net) and [Eugene Yan](https://eugeneyan.com/).
